1. Is -A -vs Has a relationship?
In Java, we have two types of relationship: Is-A relationship: Whenever one class inherits another class, it is called an IS-A relationship. Has-A relationship: Whenever an instance of one class is used in another class, it is called HAS-A relationship


2. There are four types of Java access modifiers:------



Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.

Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.

Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.
